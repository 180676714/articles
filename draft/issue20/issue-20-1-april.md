## 终身学习的一代人 -- Andy Matuschak 采访

**Andy, thanks for taking the time to sit down with us. Could you tell us a bit about how you got into programming?**

**Andy，谢谢你抽空接受采访。可以跟我们谈谈你是如何开始编程的吗？**

I think, like many people, it was through games. I actually wasn't allowed to have game consoles for a certain period of my youth, and in that period I went to the public library a lot. When I was nine, I found these books that were meant, I think, to teach programming, but in fact they just had huge listings of basic source code. There were entire books that were source listings, and they were source listings for games. So when I would play games I would type in this book of source, and often there would be a syntax error halfway through, and I wouldn't understand the error messages, and wouldn't know how to fix them. So I'd have to start over, and then I could play the game, and after a little bit of doing that I realized that I could change the games, and very rapidly things degraded from there. I learned C++ — I guess I was 10 — because that was what people made games with, and tried to write a [MUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD) — that was my first big project. It went okay...

我想应该跟很多人一样是从游戏开始的。小时候有段时间，是不允许我玩游戏机的，于是我就经常去公共图书馆。在我九岁的时候，我发现那些我以为是教编程的书其实只是罗列了源码。还有一些讲游戏设计的书整本都是源码。于是当我想玩游戏的时候就把这些源码输入计算机，但又常常半路遇到语法错误，而我当时还不能理解这些错误信息，也不知道如何解决。所以我不得不重来一遍，直到我终于可以玩这个游戏，如此反复之后我意识到我可以修改这个游戏，而很快的的一切就从那儿开始了。我学了 C++ -- 那时我大概 10 岁 -- 因为人们是用它写游戏的，我试图写一个 [MUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD) 游戏 -- 那是我第一个大项目，还进行的不错...

**Did you finish it?**

**你完成它了吗？**

I got it all going happily as a single-player situation, but of course that does not accomplish the multi-user part of a MUD — so I suppose in a way, no. I got distracted by graphics, getting obsessed with GL and 3D rendering and all that.

单玩家模式下所有功能都可以很正常的运行，但多玩家的模式没有完成 -- 所以我想答案应该是没有吧。因为后来我转移注意力到图形方向去了，开始迷恋上 GL 和 3D 渲染之类的事情。

**And then you kept on making games?**

**然后你就继续做游戏？**

I was doing game engine stuff for a while, going through all your normal OpenGL tutorials, all the spinning cubes and particle engines and all that stuff, and I started making actual games. And then, it was really a case of a 13-year-old yak shaving. I realized that I didn't have a graphics tool that was good for making the content of the games. So, my roommates and I started making a pixel editor. It was called Pixen. That was my introduction to Cocoa and it was open source. When we hit 1.0, I think I was 14, and we went to the OS X Panther (or maybe Jaguar?) launch party at the Apple store in the mall. They had those at the time! We tried to give away CDs of our pixel editor.

我做了一阵游戏引擎之类的东西，看了所有 OpenGL 的教程，什么旋转的方块啊，颗粒引擎啊这些东西，然后我开始做真正的游戏。在那个时候，对一个 13 岁的我来说，那真是繁复的工作。我发现没有足够好的图形工具来显示游戏内容。于是，我跟我的室友开始做一个像素编辑器。我们把它叫做 Pixen。那是我第一次接触 Cocoa， 还是开源的。当我们发布 1.0 版本的时候，我当时大概 14 岁吧，我们去购物中心里面苹果商店的 OS X Panther （还是 Jaguar ？）的发布会。那个时候他们就开始搞发布会了！我们想赠送我们那个像素编辑器的 CD。

**Is there an alternative reality where you would not have become a programmer? Did you have anything else that you found super interesting?**

**是不是有其他的什么可能你就不会成为一个程序员了？你当时还对其他什么特别感兴趣吗？**

It was going to be engineering of some kind. I was fascinated by electrical engineering and even chemical engineering in little high school experiments, so it was going to be one of those things, and software engineering was what I could tinker with. At the time, I called it programming and not software engineering, and then some people told me, "No, no, you're supposed to call it computer science!" Of course, at the time, I didn't understand the interesting cultural distinction that is ongoing between computer science, software engineering, and programming, which I do actually think are useful distinct terms. But we sort of misuse them interchangeably.

我当时的理想就是成为某种工程师。我当时对电气工程挺着迷的，即便是中学的那些化学小实验，所以当时是想成为这些工程师中的一种，而软件工程是我当时真正可以着手做的。当时我把这称为编程，而不是软件工程，于是有些人告诉我：“不对不对，你应该叫它计算机科学！”当然，在当时，我并不明白在计算机科学，软件工程和编程当中暗流汹涌的文化差异，我只觉得 它们是很有用的清晰的术语。但其实我们常常把它们用错了。

**Right. So now you're a software engineer, mostly?**

**好勒。那你现在基本上就是软件工程师了？**

I'm definitely not a computer scientist, although that's where my training is. I would say that I am sort of a software engineer, and I am a heavily computer science-influenced software engineer. And I spend about half of my time these days on more research stuff, reading papers and books on child development and working through ideas for how we might help that.

我肯定不是计算机科学家，虽然我是学这个的。我觉得我差不多算是软件工程师，一个深受计算机科学影响的软件工程师。不过我最近花了更多时间做一些儿童发育方面的研究，读论文和书籍，分析设想，我们希望能在这个方向略尽绵力。

**Leaving Apple and going to Khan Academy, helping people to learn and to educate, seems like quite a big jump. Why did it happen? What motivated you to do that?**

**离开 Apple 去 Khan Academy，帮助人们学习和教育，看起来是个不小的跨越。这是怎么发生的呢？是什么促动你的？**

Well, there are a few ways I can approach that question... I went to this college, Caltech, that fed into a lot of national science programs, NASA and DARPA and things like that, and so the discussions there were always about human scale impact. And we had the NASA administrator at the time come by and say to us, "OK. You're the best and brightest. You're going to one of the best research universities in the world, and you are privileged, and you have all of these possibilities open to you. Good for you. Now, you have to use them for good. You have to do something that matters."

这个， 我想我可以从其他一些事来回答这个问题... 我之前去了 Caltech，这所学院支持了大量自然科学的项目，诸如 NASA 和 DARPA，所以当时的讨论都集中在人性化影响上。当时有一个 NASA 的人过来对我们说：“好了，你们是最优秀的，而你们即将去世界上最好的研究学院之一，你们将有幸看到无数可能。这真是太棒了，你们必须利用它们来做些真正有意义的事情。”

When I got out in the broader software community, I was one of the only people who didn't go into research. I wanted to make things at the time when I graduated. I was disappointed by the impact and the ambition of most commercial software engineering and sales — so I thought long and hard about where I could make an impact. The first step for that was really deciding the metric of what that impact is and what matters. I've been heavily influenced by the work of the physicist [David Deutsch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Deutsch), and, through him, have sort of derived the metric for myself that I want to expand the reach of human knowledge and ability. So I thought about how I might do that.

在更广一点的软件社区里面，我是少数的几个没有去做研究的人之一。刚毕业的时候我希望能做一些事情，但我对大多数商业软件销售目标和实际销售量非常失望，于是我冥思苦想到底可以在哪个领域发挥专场， 而最踏出的第一步最终决定了我的方向。我深受物理学家 [David Deutsch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Deutsch) 的影响，通过他确认了我想要走的方向，那就是扩展人类知识和能力范围。继而我就开始思考怎样才可以做到。

We would expand our reach if we lived longer, so there are great opportunities there in biotech and chemical engineering. And we would expand our reach if we had better tools for experimentation. And so fabrication tools and synthesis tools are appealing, virtual reality is appealing, artificial intelligence strongly is appealing along that axis. But eventually I decided that, given my background and my opportunities, making a contribution to education would be my best bet, because if I can create a generation of lifelong learners, then we will have more people trying to solve these problems.

如果人类能活得更久一些，那么在生物技术和化学工程会有很多的机遇。如果人类有更好的工具进行试验，那么在工具制造，综合工具，虚拟现实，特别是人工智能都有很多的机会，这都会扩展我们的视野。但基于我的背景和机遇，我最终决定在教育方面做一些贡献，我认为这将会是更好的选择。因为如果我可以创造终生学习的一代人，那么我们将有更多的人来解决这些问题。

**So you want to build tools for coming generations to learn better, so that they can solve difficult problems going forward?**

**那么你是想为后代打造一些帮助学习的工具以便于他们解决更艰难的问题？**

Yes, that's my hope. A big challenge in learning is about the meta learning. It's a way for people to learn without destroying their self confidence. It's a way for people to learn without destroying their attitude toward education. I would be satisfied with the same efficacy: if the tools I create yield the same math scores for graduates, if only their attitudes toward math were better at the end and they were more interested in continuing to learn later on in life.

是的，那是我的期望。学习的一大挑战就是元学习（meta learning，学习如何学习）。那是一种可以不必摧毁自信或或摧毁学习态度的学习方式。如果我开发的这些工具不但可以让毕业生得到相同成绩，并且他们最终不但对数学有更好的认知而且会更倾向于在之后的生活中学习数学，那我就达到目标了。

**So clearly you think that the schools and universities we have already are not good enough — could you elaborate on this?**

**看起来很显然你并不满意我们已有的教育？你可以详细谈谈吗？**

No, it's not good enough. And it's not good enough along many axes. So the most fundamental axis along which it's not good enough is that most people don't have access to what I just described. And that's, I think, the most important thing to fix and the thing to fix first. And that's why the mission right now is a free education for everybody. And Khan Academy's mission is actually a free *world-class* education for everybody, so we're perhaps focusing on the free and for everybody part first, and then world-class will come. But that gets to the second point, which is that I'm not really satisfied with what counts as world-class right now.

是的，它还不够好，并且在很多方面都不够好。最缺乏的是没有让学生得到刚才我说到的那些资源，我觉得那是最重要并且最首要需要改善的事情。所以这就是为什么现在的任务是给所有人提供免费教育，而 Khan Academy 的使命是为大家提供 *世界一流* 的免费教育。所以现在我们会先将重点集中在为大家提供免费教育上面，接下来会是世界一流的免费教育，但那是后续的事了，因为我对什么才能算是世界一流还有些考虑。

I had so many classmates who had the best education money could buy and were taught by Nobel laureates. Nevertheless, they had awful attitudes toward learning, and considered themselves done as soon as they graduated. They just wanted to go off and find some steady job, where they can kind of turn their brains off, because they'd been so beaten down by the system and their curiosity and intellect had been so damaged.

我有很多同学接受了最好的付费教育，由诺贝尔获奖者授课。尽管如此，他们的学习态度却很糟，认为一毕业就算完。他们只想结束这一切然后去找份稳定的工作，放空大脑，因为他们已经打下了江山而好奇心跟智慧也已经枯竭。

**That sounds like a big frustration...**

**听上去真让人沮丧...**

I think so. I think you ask most people what they think of math and they say either, "Oh, math's boring," or "I'm not good at math. I'm not a math person." You get similar responses for sciences. If you ask people about literature, maybe they'll talk about some books whose plots they found interesting, but they used to read in school, and now that's kind of over. So I suppose the biggest change I would like to affect is to change our perception of education being over after college is done, which is not really a technical problem, and that's why I sort of hesitate with the label "Software Engineer." That's definitely where a lot of my expertise is, but my ambitions are bleeding elsewhere.

是啊。如果你问什么是数学，大多数人都会回答说：“哦，数学很无聊。”或者“我数学不好，我不太喜欢数学。”。如果你问他们对科学的态度，答案也类似。但如果问到文学，或许他们会谈论一些他们读过的书籍里的有趣桥段，但那也只是他们学生时代读过的罢了，现在已经停止阅读了。所以我最期望影响的是改变人们认为教育随着大学毕业一并终止了这一认知。而这其实并不是一个技术问题，所以我对给我自己贴上“软件工程师”的标签有些顾虑。虽然我大部分的经验与之相关，但我的目标是却不是这个方向。

**With this really big plan, focusing on lifelong learning, do you have a vision where you want to be in 10 years, what you would like to have achieved?**

**既然你现在的计划集中在终生学习上面，那你对你十年后的愿景是怎样的呢？你期望达到什么目标？**

Right now, the standard means of learning are broadly prescriptive. What I mean by that is that you read a textbook, and you passively absorb that information, or you watch a video, you watch a lecture. You are meant to sit and absorb, and perhaps there's a conversation afterward if you are wealthy. After you graduate, you just sort of have to construct those things for yourself. I'm really interested in so-called constructivist learning environments. That's a term from [Papert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert), who was a learning researcher a few decades ago. In a constructivist learning environment, the student creates the knowledge for herself, rather than by reading it from a text and passively absorbing it. In these models, it's a little bit more like an environment that has been constructed, such that the features of the environment will encourage or require you to have understood something in order to manipulate them.

眼下，学习的标准含义已经被普遍认可。不论是读一本书，看一个视频还是一个演讲，你都是被动的吸收知识。你只用坐在那接收，或许如果你有点闲钱还可以在之后继续延伸的学习。但当你毕业之后，你必须自己去创造这样的学习环境。我对所谓的构建式学习环境（constructivist learning environments）很感兴趣。这是一位几十年前的学习研究者 [Papert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert) 创造的术语。在构建式学习环境下，学生由被动的从教科书里学习转变成自主的创造知识。在这样的模式下，会更像是创造了一种环境，让你在这样的氛围中积极主动的理解事物继而掌握它们。

The example from Papert's research is that he was trying to use [Logo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)) to teach children not about programming really, but about abstractions and procedural thinking, and so he had a classroom where there was the literal physical Logo turtle. There was a mechanical turtle at the time. It would draw on physical paper. And so surrounding the classroom were drawings that the turtle had made. On some of these drawings were source code, and on many of them were not. And the drawings would change over time, with the students, and the idea is that the student would maybe see a flower and the student would say, "Oh, I like that drawing. Can I have it?" And the instructor would say, "Well, you can have it. You just have to type this code into the thing and then the turtle will draw it." And the student will say, "OK, cool," and will have the drawing, but will look at another one, and that one doesn't have the source code.

Papert 的研究里有一个例子，他尝试用 [Logo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)) 来教学生抽象及程序性思维，而不是编程本身。 他甚至有一个教室里挂了一个 Logo 的海龟的标志。那时候还有一种机械海龟，可以在纸上作画。这个教室四周挂满了画，有些是源代码生成的，有些不是。这些画作会随着一批批的学生换掉，因为比如有些学生会看到一朵花然后说：“哦，我喜欢那个图，能给我吗？”然后教师会说：“当然可以，不过你必须输入这些代码，海龟会按代码画出这个图。”接着学生会说：“好的。”然后开始画画，或者看上其他画作，但那些并没有源代码。

These other drawings in the environment are designed so as to require that the student understood something in order to have produced them. So the environment is sculpted in that way. The hypothesis that I'm investigating, and likely will be investigating for many years, is that by allowing people to construct knowledge for themselves, we can hopefully — I will be happy with this — achieve the same learning outcomes, first off. But with much-improved metacognitive outcomes — that is, their self esteem is higher, their attitude toward learning is higher, their interest in learning more is greater.

教室里其他没有源码画作是被设计出来的，需要学生理解原理后制作出来。创造性环境就这样塑造出来了。我正在研究的这个很可能会研究很多年假说，首先是允许人们自助的构建知识，那么将很可能得到同样的学习效果，当然如果达到这一结果我会非常高兴，不仅如此，他们还会在自我认知，学习态度和学习兴趣上都比其他同学高出不少。

**Next to the more active learning that the constructivist approach encourages, another major difference between what you're doing at Khan Academy and more traditional lines of education is that you're free to learn what you want to learn and when you want to learn it. What do you think is the impact of this change?**

**除了用构建式方式鼓励人们更主动的学习之外，另一个相比你在 Khan Academy 做的和更传统的教育方式之间的主要区别是更自由的选择想学习什么以及什么时候学习。那么你觉得这个改变有什么影响呢？**

Another child development researcher, [Piaget](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Piaget), has a lot to say about this. He says that one of the very important things that must happen in our development of young minds is the training of autonomy. And autonomy is meant here in a broader sense than what we normally mean when we talk about autonomy. It's not just autonomy in the sense of "I'm free to play on the playground," but autonomy like, "I am making my own choices — broadly, in general — for all of the things that are going on in my life." This is contravened by somebody telling you how to spend your day, or by an appeal to authority. For example, a heteronomous answer to "Bobby cheated when we played this game" would be "Oh, well let me go talk to Bobby." The opposite of that, an autonomous answer, would be for the teacher to say "And what did you say to Bobby?" I think the training of autonomy is important for many reasons. There is some research that suggests that it provides greater outputs in the short term, but my belief is that it will lead to greater thinkers long term. 

另外有一个儿童发育研究者 [Piaget](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Piaget) 对此有很多的研究成果。他认为对青年一代的开发当中最重要的事情之一是对自主性的训练。而这里的自主性比我们平时认为的自主性还要更宽范一些。不是“我可以随便的玩”这样的自主性，而是“我正在对我生活中所有的的事情做决定”。这跟其他人来告诉你要怎么分配你的时间或诉诸权威是相抵触的。比如说，常规性的回答“Bobby 在玩游戏的时候作弊了”这样的问题，会是“哦，我去找他谈谈”。与之相反的，如果是自主性的回答将会是“那么你是怎么跟 Bobby 说的？”。我认为自主性的训练在各方面都是非常重要的。有些研究认为这会在短期内得到更好的效果，但我认为从长期来说也会引导出更善于思考的人。

I'm skeptical of an entire day being scheduled by someone other than the student. I feel more positively about the idea, though, of an educator modifying the environment of the student, day to day, in a way that is sort of sculpted for the students' progress. For instance, to be a little more specific, I think we can do better than giving the student the entire catalogue of human knowledge, with every element of that catalogue being sort of emphasized to the same degree. If we picture all of human knowledge as books on a bookshelf, we should place the books on the lowest shelf that we think would be best for the toddler coming up to it.

我对那种一整天的日程都被别人安排的情况很质疑。我认为如果一个导师以日复一日的调整学生的学习环境来达到修正学生学习进程的方式会是更积极的。确切一点，举个例子，比方说与其一次性给学生全部人类知识的目录，并且把每个知识点都按重要程度分类，我认为更好的方式是把所有的知识都看成是书架上的书，然后按难易程度由低到高的摆放。

**Is there something you miss from your time working at Apple?**

**那么在 Apple 有没有什么很让你怀念的呢？**

Yeah, I miss the people. That's a big thing. This is actually something I find really frustrating about the industry right now. There are so many brilliant people locked up in these enormous corporations, and occasionally they're being put to good use, but often they're just gears in a machine and their intellectual contributions could be enormous and so much more impactful. I don't just mean working on my projects. I mean it broadly, in general. It makes me sad both because I miss them, on a very sentimental level — I miss having that stimulating conversation with these very experienced people who, for example, were at NeXT. But I also wish that their impact could be greater.

当然，我怀念那儿的人，这太重要了。事实上这正是我对这个行业感到一些失望的地方。有这么多优秀的人被局限在这些巨型公司里，他们只是偶尔被善加利用，但更经常的情况下他们只是一台机器的零件，但以他们的智慧其实可以做更大更影响深远的贡献。我并不是说一定要来我这个项目，我是指更广泛的情况。让我觉得有点伤感的不仅仅情感上的想念，我更怀念的是诸如当时在 NeXT 和那些非常有经验的人进行的非常有激发性的谈话。我仍然希望他们可以发挥更大的影响力。

**Can you tell us a bit more about your time at Apple? What was it like to build a framework that's used by so many people? And how did you get there from building games?**

**可以多分享一下在 Apple 的时光吗？开发一个被如此多人使用的体系是个什么体验？而你又是怎么从做游戏一步步达到的？**

One of the dots filling this gap was this framework I built when I was 16, called Sparkle. That taught me a little bit about the realities of framework development, namely that you change APIs on people, and then they get angry. It's one of the fundamental realities of framework development, but honestly, I really didn't understand what I was doing until I got to Apple, and that was kind of the point. I finished college, and I had these broader ambitions, but Apple seemed like a great place to train, and it was. It still is — I would still recommend it to anybody for that reason. I worked on a team of people who have been building frameworks for 10+ years, and I guess I was kind of thrown in the deep end. I was forced to really rapidly train and understand many unusual and unique concerns when designing frameworks at that scale. Especially frameworks with binary compatibility concerns, which Sparkle did not have. Luckily, everybody around me was incredibly generous with their time and attention and I got great mentorship. After making many, many mistakes, I understood what the hell I was doing, and then a couple years later I left and may never use those skills again...

填补这中间的鸿沟的一件事是当我16岁的时候，我写了一个叫 Sparkle 框架。它让我认识到了到了一些框架开发的现实，比如说你要修改 people 的 API，然后他们生气了。这是框架开发的基本现实之一，但老实说其实我在到 Apple 之前并不知道我当时在干嘛。我完成了学业，我有了更大的雄心，而 Apple 看起来是个非常好的学习地点，事实上也是。其实现在也仍然是，所以我还是会跟那些跟我当时抱一样想法的人提出相同的建议。跟我共事的团队是开发了这个体系超过十年的人们，而我差不多是当中垫底的。于是我被迫非常快速的学习和理解许多设计这种规模框架所需的独特的角度。尤其是考虑框架的二进制兼容（binary compatibility）问题，而 Sparkle 并没有考虑过。幸运的是，我周围的人都非常慷慨的付出他们的时间和精力帮助我进步。在犯了很多很多错误之后，我终于意识到我都干了些什么蠢事儿，而当我几年后离开，之后大概再也用不到那些技术。

**What was the biggest surprise for you in building frameworks at this scale?**

**开发这样大型规模的框架里面最让你吃惊的是什么**

I think binary compatibility was my greatest surprise. I did not understand the difficulties and complexities which it induced. So, to illustrate, those are bugs of the form: on iOS 8, this button has a white background, and on iOS 7, it's transparent. iOS 8 hadn't been released yet, so it must be our fault. You start digging a little bit and you realize that maybe a method was called in iOS 7 which took care of this issue, but this method is not called anymore on iOS 8. Then very rapidly this deteriorates into disassembling third-party code to which you do not have the source, in order to try to figure out what's going on. About half the time, somebody was doing something heinous and this was the strange way in which that manifested, and half the time we had changed something in an unexpected way, and we would need to add some defenses for this reason.

我认为二进制兼容是最让我吃惊的事情。我当时并不理解当中的困难和复杂。这都是通过 bug 渐渐清晰的，比如在 iOS8，按钮是白色背景，但在 iOS7 里面它是透明的。iOS8 还没有发布，所以这肯定是我们自己的问题。于是你开始一点点钻研，发现可能在 iOS7 里调用的一个方法是控制这个的，但这个方法在 iOS8 里已经不被调用了。然后很快的你为了知道怎么回事，去分解，追溯，结果发现这是一个第三方的代码，而且你还没有源代码。基本上有一半的时间，有些人在做一些奇怪的令人发指的事以达到效果，而另一半时间我们用一些非常规的手段做了些改动，于是我们需要因此增加一些补丁。

***That sounds like a lot of work...***

***听上去有好多事儿...***

Yeah, it was sort of detective work.

是啊，差不多就像侦探似的工作。

**It sounds a little bit like what Peter Steinberger is doing in the other direction, disassembling UIKit to fix bugs...**

**听上去 Peter Steinberger 走的是另一个方向， 反编译 UIKit 来改 bug**

Yeah, for sure. The releases were so secret that we couldn't ask, "Hey, Facebook guys, why are you doing this?" We'd have to figure it out. On this note, I absolutely admire the work that Peter and his team are doing. I think that's a great thing, and I would love to see more of that. I would love to see more development of frameworks by the community. Facebook's making great contributions there — GitHub as well.

是的，肯定是。每个版本都是很机密的，我们不可能问：“嗨，Facebook 的哥们儿，你们为什么要这么做啊？”我们必须自己搞明白。在这一点上我非常的敬佩 Peter 跟他的团队的工作。我认为那是非常好的事情，也很乐意看到更多这样的事。我期待看到更多框架开发的团队。Facebook 做出了非常好的表率，GitHub 也是。

**I've never thought of the fact that Apple also has to disassemble other people's binaries to figure out bugs.***

**我从来没想过 Apple 也需要反编译其他人的包来分析 bug**

Oh yeah, and as a third-party developer now, I have to disassemble UIKit on a pretty regular basis, because I'm like, "UIKit, why the hell?" And the easiest way to get an answer is to just look at the disassembly.

是啊，我现在作为一个第三方开发者，也不得不时不时的反编译UIKit，因为我想知道“UIKit，你在干嘛啊？”这样的问题，而回答这个问题最简单的方式就是逆向编译。

**There was a ton of new stuff last year. What are you really excited about? You're also excited about Swift?**

**去年有无数的新产品面世，有没有哪个让你激动？你对 Swift 的出现兴奋么？**

Yeah, these are pragmatic excitements, I should say. When we talk about what stuff I'm really excited about, it is not in the consumer software engineering industry in general. But as far as helping me get my work done, the category of things I'm most excited about are really interactive prototyping tools. So if you're trying to make an interaction that did not exist before — or even one that sort of vaguely has existed before — there really are no tools for it. We're still broadly designing in Photoshop. When you design in Photoshop, you produce something that looks like you designed in Photoshop. I remember at Apple, I could tell the difference between stuff that was made according to specs that came in from Photoshop, and stuff that was made according to specs that came in via After Effects, and stuff that was made according to specs that came in via live prototypes — it was a huge difference. So there are some tools out there that are trying to do this. I think none of them have gotten it right yet, but I am watching this with great fascination, hoping to contribute as well.

是，我得说这些都挺让人激动的。如果说真正让我激动的事，却并不是在消费软件工程行业。可以帮助我工作的那一类里面，最让我激动的是真正的交互式原型工具。比如你想要做一个以前从来不存在的交互，或者有这样的概念但并没有真正的工具的交互的时候。我们大多数仍然只是在 Photoshop 中去设计它。当你在 Photoshop 上设计的时候，你只是在创造一个你在 Photoshop 中设计的一样的东西。我记得在 Apple 的时候，我可以分辨出最初从 Photoshop 还是 After Effects 还是现场模型中得来的需求，这之间有非常大的区别。现在有一些工具可以做这件事，虽然我觉得他们都乏善可陈，但我还是非常热诚的关注着，希望能有所贡献。

**You mean tools like Framer?**

**你是指像 Framer 这样的工具吗？**

Yeah, Framer is a pretty good example. I'm very interested in things like Form, which was just bought by Google, and Origami, of course, which is interesting. I worked on a prototyping tool internal to Apple that got some things more right and other things less right. Each of these tools has pros and cons. We've actually been compiling a list of "you might use this tool for this purpose, you might use this tool for this purpose." We find that we have to bounce around. I feel that none of them actually excel at any of the purposes except perhaps making things that are very much like things that already exist. 

是的，Framer 是一个不错的例子。我对刚刚被 Google 收购的 Form 这样的产品很感兴趣， 当然还有 Origami，也很有意思。我在 Apple 参与了一个原型工具的内部项目，它在有些方面要做的好一些，而另一些方面欠缺一点。每种工具都有优点缺点，我们差不多维护了一个罗列着“这个工具可以用来干这个，那个工具更适合做那个”的表单，我们不得不来回挑选。我认为它们除了做那些非常类似于早已存在的工具做的事情之外并没有在某个方面特别的擅长。

**Do you think storyboards are also moving in this direction?**

**你是否觉得 storyboard 也在朝这方面走呢？**

Well, I don't think so, but I'll have to lunge out a bit to explain. There are discrete modes of interaction and there are continuous modes of interaction. Something like a mouse click is a discrete form of interaction and something like a gesture is a continuous form of interaction. Similarly, there are discrete states of your application and there are continuous states of your application. So something like scrolling around a scroll view is continuous, and navigating to a different level of a navigational stack is discrete.

这个我并不这么认为，但我想我必须进一步解释一下。交互有离散模式和连续模式。像鼠标点击就是离散模式的交互，而手势就是连续模式的交互。类似的，你的应用也有离散状态和连续状态。例如滚动就是连续的而导航到导航栈（navigational stack）的其他层就是离散的。

Storyboards allow you to manipulate only the discrete and discrete section of that quadrangle. You can make it so that when you tap a thing, then there is a discrete transition to a completely different place. But I find that to be the least interesting kind of interaction, and frankly, I think that our user interfaces are dominated by that kind of interaction primarily because we don't have tools that allow us to think about other kinds.

Storyboard 只允许你控制那个四四方方的空间内的离散区域。因此你可以点屏幕上一个部件，然后有一个离散事件传送到另一个地方。这种交互是最常见的，而且说实话我认为这种交互占据了大部分，因为我们没有一个工具来让我们思考其他模式的交互方式。

But even starting in iOS 7, the sort of discrete modes are blurred a great deal. For example, being able to tap a table view cell and expand something beneath it — it's a very trivial example of something that storyboards would already have difficulty representing.

不过从 iOS7 起，这种离散模式也的边界也开始比较模糊了。比如可以点击一个表单的单元格然后展出单元格下面的内容。这是一些很简单的例子但却很难用 storyborad 实现。

**We would need more [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com)s working on that problem.**

**我们需要更多像 [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com) 这样的人来解决这种问题。**

We do, and that's part of why I wish fewer people were making photo-sharing apps.

是的，那也是为什么我希望没有那么多人去做照片分享类 app 的原因。

**You mentioned before that the consumer software engineering space is actually less exciting to you. What excites you outside this space?**

**你之前提到说消费类软件工程不是你感兴趣的领域，那么这个领域之外你感兴趣的是什么呢？**

I've been reading a lot of papers in different fields, and I'm still wrapping my head around this. I think the ones that have stood out to me recently have been about child development, or about educational or pedagogical models. One of the most exciting ones I read was a survey in which a classroom of first graders who are five were given no formal math instruction of any kind, and instead they were given a bunch of activities which change day by day that were just placed around their environment, that were games. After a year they were assessed, and even though the children hadn't been taught any formal arithmetic methods, they were all able to answer these questions and had great metacognitive characteristics as well. Things like that are incredibly exciting to me.

我阅读了各种不同领域的资料，我仍然在思考这个问题。最近让我注目的是儿童发育或者教育，教学模式这些方面。我读到的最让我兴奋的调查结果是有一个班的只有五岁的一年级学生，老师并没有给他们常规的数学指导，而是一个氛围，由一系列慢慢调整的活动组成，而这些活动都是游戏。一年之后，他们进行了评估，虽然这些学生并没有学习正式的算术方法，但他们都能够答对问题并且有非常独特的认知。这样的事情让我非常的激动。

**So what's the most important thing you learned since starting at Khan Academy?**

**那么你进 Khan Academy 以来学到的最重要的事情是什么**

Leading teams is hard...

队伍不好带啊...

**Why?**

**为什么？**

It is a distinct skill set in which I had little practice. In the software industry, we throw individual contributing engineers into leadership roles on a pretty regular basis and expect them to excel when, of course, it is a distinct skill set, and we have to recognize that and appreciate that. So, a lot of learning has been required there.

这是一种独特的技能，而我之前并没有经验。在软件行业，我们总是让一些有贡献的工程师去做领导的角色，并期望他们脱引而出。当然，鉴于这是一项特殊的技能，我们必须感激他们做的不错，因为需要学习大量的知识。

**You mentioned earlier that you had really good mentors at Apple. What made them good and what did you learn from them?**

**你之前提到过你在 Apple 有很好的导师，为什么他们如此出色？而你又从他们那学到什么呢？**

The primary thing that made them good was the generosity with their time. That was always a challenge at Apple. Apple had the problem that it culturally does not value mentorship. One is not particularly rewarded for that, and teaching and learning is not really built into the culture.

首先因为他们真的非常慷慨的花时间来做我的导师。在 Apple 总是有很多的挑战，但 Apple 的文化有个问题是它并不看重导师的价值。因为 Apple 对此没有特别的奖励，而且教导和学习也没有被纳入企业文化构建当中来。

Anyway, I was fortunate enough to be able to pester a few people into spending a fair amount of time teaching me things, and in certain cases I made mistakes egregious enough to have people spend their time teaching me things without requiring pestering. And let's see, what made it effective? Probably their experience. The industry is an interesting place right now, because it's flooded by new grads, and the new grads are noisy and they're on Twitter and they're the ones that are speaking at conferences. But this industry has been around for a while. And there sure are a whole lot of software engineers with 15 or 20 years of professional experience in the field, and they're not as noisy. You don't read stuff by them all the time. They're mostly locked away in companies, where they can't talk, but they sure do know a lot.

不管怎样，我真的非常幸运能有人花了很多时间来教我做事，并且当我犯了严重错误的时候能花时间主动帮助我。那么是什么让人印象深刻呢？大概是他们的经验吧。这个行业现在非常有趣，因为充斥了新毕业生，而正是这些新毕业生在 Twitter 上叽叽喳喳，在会议上演讲。但这个行业已经形成有一段时间了，肯定有很多有 15 或 20 年相关领域经验的软件工程师，但他们并不经常发声。你很难听到他们的声音，因为他们基本上都不在大公司里，他们不说但是他们肯定知道很多。

**At Khan Academy, you and your team adopted Swift very quickly. Can you tell us a bit about your experience?**

**在 Khan Academy，你跟你的团队很快就适应了 Swift。你可以跟我们分享一下你的经验吗？**

We have something like 20,000 lines of Swift code, and there are four contributors to that particular project, all contributing in Swift. And the issue that I have or that I've spoken to is really an issue of practicality versus idealism. I'm sure the issues that I have with the language itself are temporary, and they don't really matter in the grand scheme of things, just in the same sense that any app that you can build in six months probably doesn't matter. So take my complaints with a grain of salt. As far as the long-term health of the ecosystem and of professional software development goes, I think it will be an excellent contribution, and these rocky first months don't particularly matter.

我们大概有 20000 行 Swift 的代码，那个项目有四位开发人员，都用 Swift 写代码。我想这个问题我已经谈过的就是实用和理想主义的冲突。我相信语言本身的问题都是暂时的，并不能造成宏观的影响，对于你可以在 6 个月时间做出来的 app 来说，这些问题都不重要。所以可以对我的说的不置可否，只要专业软件开发的生态系统能长期健康发展，我认为这将会是一个非常好的贡献，而头几个月的磕磕碰碰不值一提。

On the plus side, it has helped us to write clearer code. That's the primary thing that I enjoy when I read a Swift interface. When I read a block of Swift code, I have a much better idea of what's happening and what's not going to happen. I can see return values and the return values tell me more. I can use enums to model more accurately the states of the system, we can use value types in order to constrain and confine and limit dependencies, most critically. More broadly, we can move toward this pattern that I strangely endorse, which is really treating UIKit as a library and not as a framework. 

积极的一面来说，Swift 让我们的代码更清晰。这是我读 Swift 接口的时候让我最高兴的事情。比如 Swift 的 block 代码，我可以更清楚当前发生以及接下来要发生的事情。我可以看到返回值并且可以从中理解更多。我可以用更准确的方式来枚举模型里的系统状态。我们可以更准确的以约束，限制，依赖的方式来使用值类型（value types）。更广的说，我很赞同这种把 UIKit 当成一种库而不是框架的模式。

In terms of problems, the tooling is not there, and that's not a dig on the engineers. I happen to think, actually, that the Swift engineering team is one of Apple's finest engineering teams, but it's not done yet. It's full of bugs, it crashes too often. It generates faulty code occasionally. Most critically for us, it's just really slow. Really, really slow. The lack of incremental compilations is the biggest pain point for me. We're building a UI application, and as much as I'd like to spend all of my time thinking about how to improve learning, at some point, I've got to polish interactions and animations, and doing that with a two-minute turnaround time is really damaging — not only to productivity but actually to just morale. It just makes everybody angry. Everybody's just angry, all the time. And worse, it makes us lazy. We don't want to change stuff — so I would not be surprised if the Swift-implemented UI areas of this application turn out less polished than the areas of the application implemented in Objective-C, just because we can't iterate on it without going insane.

如果说问题的话，没有工具，工程师也不能深究。事实上我其实觉得 Apple 的 Swift 开发团队是最优秀的团队，但是工作还没有完成。现在还到处都是 bug，经常崩溃，偶尔还会生成错误代码。更严重的是，它真的很慢。非常非常慢。不能增长式编译是最大的问题。我们编译一个界面应用，因为我基本花了所有的时间来思考怎么提升学习，但某个时候我必须来优化交互和动画，虽然只是短时间的打断但真的影响很大 -- 并不仅仅是效率而是士气。这让所有人都很愤怒，基本上所有时间所有人都很愤怒。更糟的是，这让我们变懒了。我们不想改，所以如果用 Swift 实现的 UI 比 Objective-C 实现的 UI 更难看我一点都不会吃惊，因为在上面的迭代总是让我们崩溃。

But that's temporary; I'm not worried about it. They know about this and they'll fix it. It's just that expectations were mismanaged, not out of malice, but I think Apple just didn't know, and hadn't built anything this big.

但那只是暂时的，我对此并不担忧。他们知道这些而且肯定会修正这个问题。只是你无法管理预期，不是出于恶意，我认为 Apple 其实不明白而且之前并没有做过这么大型的东西。

**What effect do you think Swift will have on Apple's framework APIs? Do you expect something here in the short term?**

**你认为 Swift 会对 Apple 框架的 API 造成什么影响呢？你认为短期内会有什么变化吗？**

I don't actually have insider knowledge here, so this is just speculation, but I think it will be a long process. At least when I was there, the teams spent the majority of their time not maintaining and improving frameworks, but really supporting market features like new screen sizes or support for new hardware. That's what takes most of the time. So it will take a conscious decision to do anything non-trivial, and I don't see that forthcoming.

我没有什么内部消息，所以我只是猜测，但我认为这会是长期的工程。至少当我在那儿的时候，团队的主要工作是维护和提升现有的框架，然后支持诸如新屏幕尺寸或者新硬件之类的市场需求。这都会花很多的时间，所以对大型的决定会更谨慎，我认为并不会很快。

I think that if we fast-forward 10 years into the future, the APIs are all going to change. I have no doubt — either that will happen or it will be an incredible disappointment. In a year, I think you'll get better annotated headers...

我认为如果我们快进到 10 年之后，API 将会完全不一样。我对此深信不疑，不然肯定会让人非常的失望。某个时候，我想大家一定会看到注释的更好的头文件...（不得不说，黑的漂亮！）

**Or we'll have somebody, like the Reactive Cocoa guys, wrapping it all up in a nice way...**

**或者我们可以有像 Reactive Cocoa 那样的人，把它封装的更好看一点...**

Yeah, that's going to happen in the short term for sure. Facebook's doing it right now, but it's not Swift. It's a C++ thing, with their components project, which I think is valorous. That's a great idea. React is a lovely design. One of the complaints that I have about my time at Apple is that, because the culture doesn't value learning, nobody read. I mean this in the sense that scientists say when they talk about reading. Nobody reads the journals. Nobody reads the papers. Nobody knows what's going on in the broader community. People didn't know about React and all this stuff. That was very frustrating. 

是啊，短期内一定会这样的。Facebook 的组件项目（components project， 其实就是React）就做得很好，但那不是 Swift，是 C++，我认为超级赞，这主意太棒了。React 是个不错的设计。我对我在 Apple 最大的怨言就在此，因为 Apple 的文化并不看重学习，所以没有人阅读。我的意思是没有人读正经的东西，没有人读杂志，没有人读报纸，没有人知道现在外面正在发生的什么。人们不知道 React 之类的东西，这真让人沮丧。

Anyway, I think those things are great contributions and I have no doubt that somebody will treat UIKit and other frameworks as libraries and wrap them up in something nicer. However, it won't get great adoption until Apple does it, and it'll forever be behind and feel like an impedance mismatch until Apple does it.

不管怎样，我认为那是非常不错的，而且毋庸置疑的是肯定会有人把 UIKit 或者其他框架当做是库来把它们封装的更好。不过，除非 Apple 自己来做否则不会是一个更好的解决办法，也会总是落后，总是不匹配一样。

**Since you've left Apple, you've also done more writing and speaking. Do you have any other plans there?**

**既然你离开了 Apple，你也开始做更多写作和演讲方面的事情。你有什么其他的计划吗？**

Mainly more of the same. I'd like to publish more open-source stuff. I've been a little bitten by that in the past. When you publish open-source stuff, funny enough, people expect you to maintain it. I think we haven't quite gotten clear the contracts that we expect socially around open-source software. There's a kind of open-source software that has a community around and is well maintained, and then there's a kind of open-source software that's just being shared for educational purposes or for interest, but not really being maintained. I probably only have time for the latter, because, frankly, software engineering is not the interesting part of the problems I'm trying to solve right now. 

基本上都一样。我希望可以发布更多的开源的东西。我之前在这上面吃过亏。很有意思的是，当你发布开源项的时候，人们还希望你去维护它。我想大家对软件开源社区的期待还没有被明确。有一些开源软件有自己的社区也能被很好的维护，而另外有一些开源软件是以教育或兴趣的目的被分享的，就不怎么被维护。我基本上只有精力做到后者，因为老实说，软件工程并不是我现在感兴趣处理的问题。
